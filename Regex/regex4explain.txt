(the collection I pulled was all saved as xml files for some reason?)

type in what u wanna find first and then the actual expression to find it

<i>music note music note</i finds songs (the character couldnt be saved on the txt file)

<!doctype html> finds the heading of the doc which I replaced with a space

next I found both </html> and <html> and replaced them with xml

<head>\s*(<title>[^<]+</title>).*</head> found everything in the head except for the title element, and I replaced using $1 to get just the title (with dot matches all enabled)

\[(.*)\] finds sounds and other details like whos speaking which I replaced with <subt>/1</subt>

<i>(.*)</i> finds references to things and also music, so I replaced it with <italics>\1</italics>
