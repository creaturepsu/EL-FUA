                                     ANNOUNCER
                         (voice-over) Futurama is brought to 
                         you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. 
                         It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!

               [Planet Express: Kitchen. Leela picks up a huge can of Kibbles 
               'n' Snouts and carries it over to a huge electric can opener 
               on the wall.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Balcony. Nibbler is asleep. His third 
               eye perks up and looks around when he hears the can opener. He 
               runs inside.]
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. Fry gets some coffee. Leela 
               tips the can over and the meat slowly slides out from inside. 
               Nibbler sits in his food dish and the meat falls on him and he 
               scoffs it in a few bites.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Aww! Somebody likes snouts.

                         Is it me?

               
               [Bender wanders in humming to himself. The magnet on the can 
               opener pulls him off the floor and starts cutting into him.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         (shouting) Ow, my head! My precious 
                         head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. 
                         You killed my father and now you've 
                         come back for me!
 
               
                                     FRY
                         You alright, Bender?

               
               [Bender rubs his head. The top half is cut like a half-open can.]

                         Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why 
                         we keep this ticking time-bomb around 
                         just for that dumb animal.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You 
                         hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him 
                         and make up.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                          No.

               
                                     LEELA
                         I said pet him.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both 
                         hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!
 
               
               [Nibbler lets go.]

                         Are you alright?

               
                                     BENDER
                         Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.
 
                         
               
                                     LEELA
                         Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.
 
                         
               
               [She carries Nibbler away and kisses and pets him.]

                         Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't 
                         see anyone kissing it.
 
               
               [Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Zoidberg puts a book down 
               and stands up from the table.]

                         (reluctant) Alright, I'm coming.

               
               [Animal Clinic Waiting Room. A man sits stroking a cat, a cat 
               sits stroking a man and Leela sits with Nibbler while Fry and 
               Bender stand nearby. A door opens and a woman comes out with 
               a two-headed dog, followed by the vet, Jeffery Grant.]
 
               
                                     JEFFERY
                         Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper 
                         gets the suppository.  Next.
 
               
               [Animal Clinic Examination Room. Veterinary surgeries haven't 
               changed much in a thousand years; there is a sink, a paper towel 
               dispenser and an examination table in the middle of the room 
               which Nibbler sits on. Jeffery fetches a small hammer and taps 
               Nibbler on the head with it, making him squeal. He looks in his 
               mouth.]

                         It's just a simple broken fang, nothing 
                         serious.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         What's that you say there, doctor? You're 
                         gonna have to put him down?
 
               
                                     JEFFERY
                         No-- what? Huh?

               
               [He looks at Fry and Leela in confusion. Bender shakes his head.]
 
               
               
                                     BENDER
                         Terrible shame that. Shall I do the 
                         honours?
 
               
               [He reaches up to a shelf and takes down a bottle with some pink 
               liquid in it marked "Goose Laxative". He holds the bottle by 
               it's neck, smashes it on a table and points it at Nibbler. Leela 
               reaches across.]

                         No!

               
               [She rips Bender's arm off and smacks it against the table until 
               it lets go of the broken bottle.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         You about done?

               
                                     LEELA
                         Next time I'm keeping it.

               
               [She tosses the arm over her shoulder and Bender reattaches it.]
 
               
               
                                     JEFFERY
                         OK, well I believe I have a replacement 
                         fang for your pet in the next room. 
                          The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but 
                         luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. 
                          Now then.
 
               
               [He pulls out the broken crown of Nibbler's fang and sets it 
               down on a table. Fry picks it up.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's 
                         fang?
 
               
               [Jeffery attaches Nibbler's new tooth with a laser.]

                         Um, I'm still a little woozy from a 
                         gazelle kick this morning but if he's 
                         anything like the common tree, the rings 
                         might indicate his age.
 
               
               [Fry laughs.]

               
                                     FRY
                         Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some 
                         kind of genius to count all those rings.
 
                         
               
               [Jeffery takes a look.]

               The room has been decorated with balloons and streamers and Fry 
               sticks a picture to the wall. Nibbler scratches himself and runs 
               around.]

                         gave me a new cape.

                         to be cooking for this party.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.

                         if someone's going to jump out of it, 
                         make sure you put them in after you

                         should get a puppy.

                         Quiet, the beast approaches.

               
               [Loud bangs come from the pipe as El Chupanibre gets closer. 
               The mutants, Fry and Bender scarper. Fry dives behind some boxes 
               and Bender and Dwayne join him. Raoul runs into a building and 
               draws the curtains across him. El Chupanibre's shadow appears 
               and Leela gasps. The huge shadow gets smaller and it turns out 
               to be Nibbler.]
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look 
                         everyone, it's El Chupanibre.
 
               
                                     DWAYNE
                         That's not El Chupanibre.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Say what?

               
                                     DWAYNE
                         That's El Chupanibre.

               
               [He points to a huge green monster standing in the pipe looking 
               down on Bender. It has fangs and yellow bloodshot eyes. Bender 
               looks round, screams, drops Nibbler and runs away.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         I'll take care of this.

               
               [He steps into the rope trap and screams as it lifts him off 
               the ground and leaves him dangling overhead. El Chupanibre gets 
               closer to Nibbler. Leela screams, making Bender scream.]
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Bender, do something.

               
                                     BENDER
                         I'm too scared.

               
                                     FRY
                         Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted 
                         straight to Bender. If you care about 
                         Nibbler, stop caring about him!
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         I can't. I love every living creature.
 
                         
               
                                     FRY
                         Even me?

               
                                     LEELA
                         As a friend.

               
                                     FRY
                         Damn.

               
               [Leela starts to cry.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at 
                         not caring. The secret is to stop giving 
                         a rat's ass about anyone else and start 
                         thinking of the things that you want, 
                         that you deserve, that the world owes 
                         you.
 
               
               [El Chupanibre edges closer to Nibbler.]

               
                                     LEELA
                         Well, I could use a new tank top.

               
                                     BENDER
                         Bigger! Bigger!

               
                                     LEELA
                         A fashionable tank top. And designer 
                         boots ... encrusted with jewels.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         Don't stop now, you'll need some pants 
                         to go with that outfit.
 
               
                                     LEELA
                         Yeah. And I could afford it all if I 
                         didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
 
                         
               
               [Bender's chip beeps.]

               
                                     BENDER
                         Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.
 
                         
               
               [He kicks Nibbler out the way and starts rotating his arms. El 
               Chupanibre grabs them and pulls them off. Bender groans. El Chupanibre 
               grabs him and lifts him towards his mouth.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Bender's gonna be killed!

                         You know what else I could use? A weekend 
                         at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
 
                         
               
               [El Chupanibre prepares to eat Bender. Bender's detached arms 
               tap him on the shoulder and he looks around. They punch him and 
               he drops Bender. Bender charges at him and knocks him flying 
               into the huge toilet. His arms flush the monster away and everyone 
               cheers.]
 
               
                                     FRY
                         (cheering) Yeah!

               
                                     LEELA
                         You did it!

               
                                     RAOUL
                         Let's have a tissue-tape parade!

               
                                     BENDER
                         No thanks.

               
               [Dwayne unties Leela and another mutant cuts Fry down. He falls 
               into the water and splutters. Nibbler runs towards Leela and 
               jumps into her arms and licks her. Dwayne sits on the toilet 
               with his guitar.]
 
               
                                     DWAYNE
                         Gather round, children, to hear the 
                         legend of Bender.
 
               [He strums the guitar.]

               (singing) He came from above with a--

               [A string snaps and he sighs.]

               (talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another 
               guitar string.
 
               
               [Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry, Leela and Bender are back 
               and everyone is with them. Bender holds a cigar.]

                         That was a disgusting story.

               
                                     LEELA
                         And it's all thanks to Bender. I love 
                         you, Bender.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         I love you too.  Get that stupid chip 
                         out of me before I kill myself!
 
               
               [Farnsworth prises the chip off with a screwdriver and looks 
               at it.]
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         Bender, you won't believe this, but 
                         the empathy chip burned out. The emotion 
                         you felt for Nibbler was actually your 
                         own.
 
               
                                     FRY
                         Looks like Bender learned an important 
                         lesson about respecting other people's 
                         feelings afterall.
 
               
               [Everyone else nods and murmurs in agreement.]

               
                                     FARNSWORTH
                         No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was 
                         running at triple capacity.
 
               
                                     BENDER
                         And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, 
                         losers!
 
               
               [He walks out.]

                         You know, Bender may not have learned 
                         anything from me, but I think I actually 
                         learned something from him.  (shouting) 
                         So long, jerkwads!
 
               
                                     FARNSWORTH
