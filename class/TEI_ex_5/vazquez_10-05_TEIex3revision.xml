            horrendous</note>
         <!--something I noticed here is just typing in a "<", you can see everything thats availble to next within the element in a list, or at least everything they included here-->
         <!--*update: not really, there are still elements which can be nested and are not shown. why? is this a limitation of oxygen or is the list really that big and complicated?-->
