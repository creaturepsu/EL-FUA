            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was beginning to get very tired of sitting by <span class="character">her sister</span> on the bank, and of having
               nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book <span class="character">her sister</span> was reading, but it had
               no pictures or conversations in it, and where is the use of a book, thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, without
               pictures or conversations? So she was considering in her own mind, (as well as she
               could, for
               the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid,) whether the pleasure of making
               a
               daisy-chain was worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when a <span class="character">white rabbit</span>
               with pink eyes ran close by her. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> There was nothing very remarkable in that, nor did <span class="character">Alice</span> think it so very much out of the
               way to hear the <span class="character">rabbit</span> say to itself "dear, dear! I shall be too late!" (when she thought it
               over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at
               the time
               it all seemed quite natural); but when the <span class="character">rabbit</span> actually took a watch out of
               its waistcoat-pocket, looked at it, and then hurried on, <span class="character">Alice</span> started to her feet,
               for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either
               a waistcoat-pocket or a watch to take
               out of it, and, full of curiosity, she hurried across the field after it, and was
               just in time
               to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In a moment down went <span class="character">Alice</span> after it,
               never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly
               down,
               so suddenly, that <span class="character">Alice</span> had not a moment to think about stopping herself, before she found
               herself falling down what seemed a deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she
               fell very
               slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her, and to wonder
               what
               would happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming
               to, but it
               was too dark to see anything: then, she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed
               that they
               were filled with cupboards and book-shelves: here and there were maps and pictures
               hung on
               pegs. <span class="nonsense">She took a jar down off one of the shelves as she passed: it was labelled "Orange
                  Marmalade," but to her
                  great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar, for fear of killing
                  somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past
                  it.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of
               tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say
               anything
               about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!" (which was most likely true.)
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? "I wonder how
               many miles I've fallen by this time?" she said aloud, "I must be getting somewhere
               near the
               centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—"
               (for you
               see <span class="character">Alice</span> had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though
               this was not a very good opportunity of showing off her knowledge, as
               there was no one to hear her, still it was good practice to say it over,) "yes that's
               the
               right distance, but then what Longitude or Latitude-line shall I be in?" (Alice had
               no
               idea what Longitude was, or
               Latitude either, but she thought they were nice grand words to say.) </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="nonsense">Presently she began again: "I wonder if I shall fall right through
                  the earth! How funny it'll be to come out among the people that walk with their heads
                  downwards! But I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
                  Please,
                  Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?"—and she tried to curtsey as she spoke (fancy
                  curtseying as you're falling through the air! do you think you could manage
                  it?) "and what an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never
                  do to ask:
                  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere."</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="litdevice">Down, down, down: there was nothing else to do, so <span class="character">Alice</span> soon began talking again. "<span class="character">Dinah</span>
                  will miss me very much tonight, I should think!" (<span class="character">Dinah</span> was the cat.) "I hope they'll remember
                  her saucer of milk at tea-time! Oh, dear <span class="character">Dinah</span>, I wish I had you here! There are no mice in
                  the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you
                  know, my
                  dear. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?" <span class="nonsense">And here <span class="character">Alice</span> began to get rather sleepy, and kept on
                     saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way "<span class="litdevice">do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?" and
                        sometimes, "do bats eat cats?"</span> for, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she
                     put
                     it.</span></span> <span class="nonsense">She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking
                  hand in
                  hand with <span class="character">Dinah</span>, and was saying to her very earnestly, "Now, <span class="character">Dinah</span>, my dear, tell me the
                  truth. Did you ever eat a bat?" when suddenly, bump! bump! down she came upon a heap
                  of sticks
                  and shavings, and the fall was over.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was not a bit hurt, and jumped on to her feet directly: she looked up, but it was
               all
               dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the white rabbit was still
               in sight,
               hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went <span class="character">Alice</span> like the wind, and just
               heard it say, as it turned a corner, "my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!"
               She turned
               the corner after it, and instantly found herself in a long, low hall, lit up by a
               row of lamps
               which hung from the roof. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked, and when <span class="character">Alice</span> had been all
               round it, and tried them all, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she
               was ever to get out again: suddenly
               she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing
               lying
               upon it, but a tiny golden key, and <span class="character">Alice's</span> first idea was that it might belong to one of the
               doors of the hall, but alas! either the locks were too large, or the key too small,
               but at any
               rate it would open none of them. However, on the second time round, she came to a
               low curtain,
               behind which was a door about eighteen inches high: she tried the little key in the
               keyhole,
               and it fitted! <span class="character">Alice</span> opened the door, and looked down a small passage, not larger than a
               rat-hole, into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that
               dark hall,
               and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
               she could
               not even get her head through the doorway, "and even if my head would go through,"
               thought
               poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it would be very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up
               like a telescope! I
               think I could, if I only knew how to begin." For, you see, so many out-of-the-way
               things had
               happened lately, that <span class="character">Alice</span> began to think very few things indeed were really impossible. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> There was nothing else to do, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might
               find
               another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting up people like telescopes:
               this
               time there was a little bottle on it—"which certainly was not there before" said <span class="character">Alice</span>—and
               tied round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME beautifully
               printed on it in large letters. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It was all very well to say "drink me," "but I'll look first," said the wise little
               <span class="character">Alice</span>,
               "and see whether the bottle's marked "poison" or not," for <span class="character">Alice</span> had read several nice little
               stories about children that got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts, and other unpleasant
               things, because they would not remember the simple rules their friends
               had given them, such as, that, if you get into the fire, it will burn you, and that,
               if you
               cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it generally bleeds, and she had never forgotten
               that, if you drink a
               bottle marked "poison," it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> However, this bottle was not marked poison, so <span class="character">Alice</span> tasted it, and
               finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
               pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it
               off. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What a curious feeling!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I must be shutting up like a telescope." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It was so indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up as
               it
               occurred to her that she was now the right size for going through the little door
               into that
               lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see whether she was
               going to
               shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this, "for it might end, you know,"
               said
               <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "in my going out altogether, like a candle, and what should I be like
               then,
               I wonder?" and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle
               is blown out, for she could not
               remember having ever seen one. However, nothing more happened so she decided on going
               into the
               garden at once, but, alas for poor <span class="character">Alice</span>! when she got to the door, she found she had
               forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for the key,
               she found
               she could not possibly reach it: she could see it plainly enough through the glass,
               and she
               tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery,
               and when she
               had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come! there's no use in crying!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself rather sharply, "I advise you to
               leave off this minute!" (she generally gave herself very good advice, and sometimes
               scolded
               herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes, <span class="nonsense">and once she remembered boxing her own
                  ears for having been unkind to herself in a game of croquet she was playing with herself,
                  for this curious child
                  was very fond of pretending to be two people,) "but it's no use now," thought poor
                  <span class="character">Alice</span>, "to
                  pretend to be two people! Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make one respectable
                  person!"</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Soon her eyes fell on a little ebony box lying under the table: she opened it, and
               found in
               it a very small cake, on which was lying a card with the words EAT ME beautifully
               printed on it in large letters. "I'll eat," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "and if it makes me larger, I can
               reach the key, and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door, so either way
               I'll get
               into the garden, and I don't care which happens!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself "which way? which way?" and laid
               her
               hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and was quite surprised
               to find
               that she remained the same size: to be sure this is what generally happens when one
               eats cake,
               but Alice had got into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the way things to happen,
               and
               it seemed quite dull and stupid for things to go on in the common way. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Curiouser and curiouser!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, (she was so surprised that she quite forgot how to
               speak good English,) "now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
               Goodbye,
               feet!" (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed almost out of sight, they
               were
               getting so far off,) <span class="nonsense">"oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and
                  stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure I can't! I shall be a great deal too far off
                  to bother
                  myself about you: you must manage the best way you can—but I must be kind to them,"
                  thought
                  Alice, "or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them
                  a new pair
                  of boots every Christmas."</span> </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="nonsense">And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it "they must go by the carrier,"
                  she thought,
                  "and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions
                  will
                  look!
                  ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
                  THE CARPET,
                  with ALICE'S LOVE</span>
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> oh dear! what nonsense I am talking!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Just at this moment, her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact, she was
               now
               rather more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key, and
               hurried
               off to the garden door. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Poor <span class="character">Alice</span>! it was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the
               garden with one eye, but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down
               and cried
               again. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "a great girl like you," (she might well
               say this,) "to cry in this way! Stop this instant, I tell you!" But she cried on all
               the same,
               shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool, about four inches deep, all
               round
               her, and reaching half way across the hall. After a time, she heard a little pattering
               of feet
               in the distance, and dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the <span class="character">white rabbit</span> coming back again, splendidly
               dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand, and a nosegay in the other.
               <span class="character">Alice</span> was
               ready to ask help of any one, she felt so desperate, and as the <span class="character">rabbit</span> passed her, she said,
               in a low, timid voice, "If you please, Sir—" the <span class="character">rabbit</span> started violently, looked up once into
               the roof of the hall, from which the voice seemed to come, and then dropped the nosegay
               and
               the white kid gloves, and skurried away into the darkness, as hard as it could go.
               </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> took up the nosegay and gloves, and found the nosegay so delicious that she kept
               smelling at it all the time she went on talking to herself—"dear, dear! how queer
               everything
               is today! and yesterday everything happened just as usual: I wonder if I was changed
               in the
               night? <span class="nonsense">Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I think I remember feeling
                  rather different. But
                  if I'm not the same, who in the world am I? Ah, that's the great puzzle!" And she
                  began
                  thinking over all the children she knew of the same age as herself, to see if she
                  could have
                  been changed for any of them.</span> </p>
            <span class="nonsense">
               <p class="paragraph"> "I'm sure I'm not <span class="character">Gertrude</span>," she said, "for her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine
                  doesn't go in ringlets at all—and I'm sure I ca'n't be <span class="character">Florence</span>, for I know all sorts of
                  things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she's she, and I'm I,
                  and—oh dear!
                  how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see:
                  four
                  times <span class="character">Five</span> is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is fourteen—oh
                  dear! I shall never get to twenty at this rate! But the Multiplication Table don't
                  signify—let's try Geography. London is the capital of France, and Rome is the capital
                  of
                  Yorkshire, and Paris—oh dear! dear! that's all wrong, I'm certain! I
                  must have been changed for <span class="character">Florence</span>! I'll try and say "How doth the little,"" and she crossed
                  her hands on her lap, and
                  began, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not sound the same
                  as they
                  used to do: </p>
               
               
               "How doth the little crocodile
               Improve its shining tail,
               And pour the waters of the Nile
               On every golden scale!
               
               
               "How cheerfully it seems to grin!
               How neatly spreads its claws!
               And welcomes little fishes in
               With gently-smiling jaws!"
               
               
               
               <p class="paragraph"> "I'm sure those are not the right words," said poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, and her eyes filled with tears as
                  she thought "I must be <span class="character">Florence</span> after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
                  house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
                  No! I've
                  made up my mind about it: if I'm <span class="character">Florence</span>, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting
                  their heads down and saying 'come up, dear!' I shall only look up and say 'who am
                  I then? answer me that
                  first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down
                  here till
                  I'm somebody else—but, oh dear!" cried Alice with a sudden burst of tears, "I do wish
                  they
                  would put their heads down! I am so tired of being all alone here!" </p></span>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> As she said this, she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to find she had
               put on one
               of the <span class="character">rabbit's</span> little gloves while she was talking. "How can I have
               done that?" thought she, "I must be growing small again." She got up and went to the
               table to
               measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about
               two
               feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: soon she found out that the reason
               of it was
               the nosegay she held in her hand: she dropped it hastily, just in time to save herself
               from
               shrinking away altogether, and found that she was now only three inches high. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Now for the garden!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she hurried back to the little door, but the little door was locked
               again, and the little gold key was lying on the glass table as before, and "things
               are worse
               than ever!" thought the poor little girl, "for I never was as small as this before,
               never! And
               I declare it's too bad, it is!" </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> At this moment her foot slipped, and splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.
               Her first
               idea was that she had fallen into the sea: then she remembered that she was under
               ground, and
               she soon made out that it was the pool of tears she had wept when she was nine feet
               high. "I
               wish I hadn't cried so much!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she swam about, trying to find her way out, "I
               shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! Well! that'll
               be a queer thing, to be sure!
               However, every thing is queer today." Very soon she saw something splashing about
               in the pool
               near her: at first she thought it must be a walrus or a hippopotamus, but then she
               remembered
               how small she was herself, and soon made out that it was only a <span class="character">mouse</span>, that had slipped in
               like herself. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Would it be any use, now," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "to speak to this <span class="character">mouse</span>? The <span class="character">rabbit</span> is something
               quite out-of-the-way, no doubt, and so have I been, ever since I came down here, but
               that is
               no reason why the <span class="character">mouse</span> should not be able to talk. I think I may as well try." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So she began: "oh <span class="character">Mouse</span>, do you know how to get out of this pool? I am very tired of
               swimming about here, oh <span class="character">Mouse</span>!" The <span class="character">mouse</span> looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to
               her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>; "I daresay it's a French mouse, come
               over with William the Conqueror!" (for,with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
               no very clear notion how long
               ago anything had happened,) so she began again: "où est ma chatte?" which was the
               first
               sentence out of her French lesson-book. The <span class="character">mouse</span> gave a sudden jump in the pool, and seemed
               to quiver with fright: "oh, I beg your pardon!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span> hastily, afraid that she had hurt
               the poor animal's feelings, "I quite forgot you didn't like cats!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Not like cats!" cried the <span class="character">mouse</span>, in a shrill, passionate voice, "would you like cats if you were me?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well, perhaps not," said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a soothing tone, "don't be angry about it. And yet I wish
               I could show you our cat <span class="character">Dinah</span>: I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
               She is such a dear quiet thing," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
               pool, "she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face:
               and she
               is such a nice soft thing to nurse, and she's such a capital one for catching mice—oh!
               I beg
               your pardon!" cried poor <span class="character">Alice</span> again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain
               that it was really offended, "have I offended you?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Offended indeed!" cried the <span class="character">mouse</span>, who seemed to be positively trembling with rage, "our
               family always hated cats! Nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't talk to me
               about them any more!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I won't indeed!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, in a great hurry to change the conversation, "are you—are
               you—fond of—dogs?" The <span class="character">mouse</span> did not answer, so <span class="character">Alice</span> went on eagerly: "there is such a nice
               little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier,
               you know,
               with oh! such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and
               it'll sit
               up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things—I ca'n't remember half of them—and
               it
               belongs to a farmer, and he says it kills all the rats and—oh dear!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> sadly, "I'm
               afraid I've offended it again!" for the <span class="character">mouse</span> was swimming away from her as hard as it could
               go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So she called softly after it: "<span class="character">mouse</span> dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats
               and dogs any more, if you don't like them!" When the <span class="character">mouse</span> heard this, it turned and swam
               slowly back to her: its face was quite pale, (with passion, <span class="character">Alice</span> thought,) and it said in a
               trembling low voice "let's get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and
               you'll
               understand why it is I hate cats and dogs." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite full of birds and animals
               that had
               fallen into it. There was a Duck and a <span class="character">Dodo</span>, a <span class="character">Lory</span> and an <span class="character">Eaglet</span>, and several other curious
               creatures. <span class="character">Alice</span> led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. </p>
            </div>
         <div id="c2">
            
            <h2 class="heading"> Chapter II </h2>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> They were indeed a curious looking party that assembled on the bank—the birds with
               draggled
               feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them—all dripping wet, cross,
               and
               uncomfortable. The first question of course was, how to get dry: they had a consultation
               about
               this, and <span class="character">Alice</span> hardly felt at all surprised at finding herself talking familiarly with the
               birds, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument
               with the
               <span class="character">Lory</span>, who at last turned sulky, and would only say "I am older than you, and must know
               best,"
               and this <span class="character">Alice</span> would not admit without knowing how old the <span class="character">Lory</span> was, and as the <span class="character">Lory</span>
               positively refused to tell its age, there was nothing more to be said.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> At last <span class="character">the mouse</span>, who seemed to have some authority among them, called out "sit down, all
               of you, and attend to me! I'll soon make you dry enough!" They all sat down at once,
               shivering, in a large ring, <span class="character">Alice</span> in the middle, with her eyes anxiously fixed on <span class="character">the mouse</span>,
               for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Ahem!" said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, with a self-important air, "are you all ready? This is the driest
               thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "<span class="character">William the Conqueror</span>, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the
               English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and
               conquest.
               <span class="character">Edwin and Morcar</span>, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Ugh!" said the <span class="character">Lory</span> with a shiver. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I beg your pardon?" said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, frowning, but very politely, "did you speak?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Not I!" said the <span class="character">Lory</span> hastily. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I thought you did," said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, "I proceed. <span class="character">Edwin and Morcar</span>, the earls of Mercia and
               Northumbria, declared for him; and even <span class="character">Stigand</span>, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it
               advisable to go with <span class="character">Edgar Atheling</span> to meet <span class="character">William</span> and offer him the crown. <span class="character">William's</span> conduct
               was at first moderate—how are you getting on now, dear?" said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, turning to <span class="character">Alice</span> as
               it spoke. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "As wet as ever," said poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it doesn't seem to dry me at all." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "In that case," said the <span class="character">Dodo</span> solemnly, rising to his feet, "I move that the meeting
               adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Speak English!" said <span class="character">the duck</span>, "I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and
               what's more, I don't believe you do either!" And <span class="character">the duck</span> quacked a comfortable laugh to
               itself. Some of the other birds tittered audibly. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I only meant to say," said <span class="character">the dodo</span> in a rather offended tone, "that I know of a house near
               here, where we could get the young lady and the rest of the party dried, and then
               we could
               listen comfortably to the story which I think you were good enough to promise to tell
               us,"
               bowing gravely to <span class="character">the mouse</span>.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">the mouse</span> made no objection to this, and the whole party moved along the river bank, (for
               the pool had by this time began to flow out of the hall, and the edge of it was fringed
               with
               rushes and forget-me-nots,) in a slow procession, <span class="character">the dodo</span> leading the way. After a time <span class="character">the
                  Dodo</span> became impatient, and, leaving <span class="character">the duck</span> to bring up the rest of the party, moved on at a
               quicker pace with <span class="character">Alice</span>, the <span class="character">Lory</span>, and the <span class="character">Eaglet</span>, and soon brought them to a little cottage,
               and there they sat snugly by the fire, wrapped up in blankets, until the rest of the
               party had
               arrived, and they were all dry again. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Then they all sat down again in a large ring on the bank, and begged <span class="character">the mouse</span> to begin his
               story. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Mine is a long and a sad tale!" said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, turning to <span class="character">Alice</span>, and sighing. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It is a long tail, certainly," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, looking down with wonder
               at <span class="character">the mouse</span>'s tail, which was coiled nearly all round the party, "but why do you call it
               sad?" and she went on puzzling about this as <span class="character">the mouse</span> went on speaking, so that her idea of
               the tale was something like this:
               </p>
            
            
            We lived beneath the mat 
            Warm and snug and fat
            But one woe, &amp; that
            Was the cat!
            To our joys
            a clog, In
            our eyes a 
            fog, On our
            hearts a log
            Was the dog!
            When the
            cat's away,
            Then
            the mice
            will
            play,
            But, alas!
            one day, (So they say)
            Came the dog and
            cat, Hunting
            for a
            rat,
            Crushed

            of that! 
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You are not attending!" said <span class="character">the mouse</span> to <span class="character">Alice</span> severely, "what are you thinking of?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I beg your pardon," said <span class="character">Alice</span> very humbly, "you had got to the fifth bend, I think?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I had not!" cried <span class="character">the mouse</span>, sharply and very angrily. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "A knot!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her,
               "oh, do let me help to undo it!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I shall do nothing of the sort!" said <span class="character">the mouse</span>, getting up and walking away from the
               party, "you insult me by talking such nonsense!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I didn't mean it!" pleaded poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "but you're so easily offended, you know." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">the mouse</span> only growled in reply. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Please come back and finish your story!" <span class="character">Alice</span> called after it, and the others all joined
               in chorus "yes, please do!" but <span class="character">the mouse</span> only shook its ears, and walked quickly away, and
               was soon out of sight. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What a pity it wouldn't stay!" sighed <span class="character">the lory</span>, and an old Crab took the opportunity of
               saying to its daughter "Ah, my dear! let this be a lesson to you never to lose your
               temper!" "Hold your tongue, Ma!" said the young Crab, a little snappishly, "you're
               enough to
               try the patience of an oyster!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I wish I had our <span class="character">Dinah</span> here, I know I do!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> aloud, addressing no one in
               particular, "she'd soon fetch it back!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "And who is <span class="character">Dinah</span>, if I might venture to ask the question?" said <span class="character">the lory</span>. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet, "<span class="character">Dinah</span>'s our cat. And
               she's such a capital one for catching mice, you can't think! And oh! I wish you could
               see her
               after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> This answer caused a remarkable sensation among the party: some of the birds hurried
               off at
               once; one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking "I really
               must be
               getting home: the night air does not suit my throat," and a canary called out in a
               trembling
               voice to its children "come away from her, my dears, she's no fit company for you!"
               On various
               pretexts, they all moved off, and <span class="character">Alice</span> was soon left alone. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She sat for some while sorrowful and silent, but she was not long before she recovered
               her
               spirits, and began talking to herself again as usual: "I do wish some of them had
               stayed a
               little longer! and I was getting to be such friends with them—really <span class="character">the lory</span> and I were
               almost like sisters! and so was that dear little Eaglet! And then <span class="character">the duck</span> and <span class="character">the dodo</span>! How
               nicely <span class="character">the duck</span> sang to us as we came along through the water: and if the Dodo hadn't known
               the way to that nice little cottage, I don't know when we should have got dry again—"
               and
               there is no knowing how long she might have prattled on in this way, if she had not
               suddenly
               caught the sound of pattering feet. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about
               it as it
               went, as if it had lost something, and she heard it muttering to itself "the Marchioness!
               the
               Marchioness! oh my dear paws! oh my fur and whiskers! She'll have me executed, as
               sure as
               ferrets are ferrets!
               Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?" <span class="character">Alice</span> guessed in a moment
               that it was looking for the nosegay and the pair of white kid gloves, and she began
               hunting
               for them, but they were now nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since
               her
               swim in the pool, and her walk along the river-bank with its fringe of rushes and
               forget-me-nots, and the glass table and the little door had vanished. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Soon <span class="character">rabbit</span> noticed <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she stood looking curiously about her, and at once said in
               a quick angry tone, "why, Mary Ann! what are you doing out here? Go
               home this moment, and look on my dressing-table for my gloves and nosegay, and fetch
               them
               here, as quick as you can run, do you hear?" and <span class="character">Alice</span> was so much frightened that she ran off
               at once, without saying a
               word, in the direction which <span class="character">rabbit</span> had pointed out. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She soon found herself in front of a neat little house, on the door of which was
               a bright
               brass plate with the name W. RABBIT, ESQ. She went in, and hurried upstairs, for fear
               she should meet the real Mary Ann and be turned out of the house before she had found
               the
               gloves: she knew that one pair had been lost in the hall, "but of course," thought
               <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it
               has plenty more of them in its house. How queer it seems to be going messages for
               a rabbit! I
               suppose <span class="character">Dinah</span>'ll be sending me messages next!" And she began fancying the sort of things that
               would happen: "Miss <span class="character">Alice</span>! come here directly and get ready for your walk!" "Coming in a
               minute, nurse! but I've got to watch this mousehole till <span class="character">Dinah</span> comes back, and see that the
               mouse doesn't get out—" "only I don't think," <span class="character">Alice</span> went on, "that they'd let <span class="character">Dinah</span> stop in
               the house, if it began ordering people about like that!"
               </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room, with a table in the window
               on
               which was a looking-glass and, (as <span class="character">Alice</span> had hoped,) two or three pairs of tiny white kid
               gloves: she took up a pair of gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her
               eye fell
               upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass: there was no label on it this
               time
               with the words "drink me," but nonetheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips:
               "I know
               something interesting is sure to happen," she said to herself, "whenever I eat or
               drink
               anything, so I'll see what this bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow larger,
               for I'm
               quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she expected: before she had drunk half the
               bottle, she found her
               head pressing against the ceiling, and she stooped to save her neck from being broken,
               and
               hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself "that's quite enough—I hope I sha'n't
               grow any
               more—I wish I hadn't drunk so much!" </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Alas! it was too late: she went on growing and growing, and very soon had to kneel
               down: in
               another minute there was not room even for this, and she tried the effect of lying
               down, with
               one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went
               on
               growing, and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up
               the
               chimney, and said to herself "now I can do no more—what will become of
               me?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Luckily for <span class="character">Alice</span>, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no
               larger; still it was very uncomfortable, and as there seemed to be no sort of chance
               of ever
               getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy. "It was much pleasanter
               at home,"
               thought poor <span class="character">Alice</span>, "when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered
               about by mice and rabbits—I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole, and yet,
               and
               yet—it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life. I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that sort of
               thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There out to be a book
               written
               about me, that there ought! and when I grow up I'll write one—but I'm grown up now"
               said she
               in a sorrowful tone, "at least there's no room to grow up any more here." </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "But then," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "shall I never get any older than I am now? That'll be a
               comfort, one way—never to be an old woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn!
               Oh, I
               shouldn't like that!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh, you foolish <span class="character">Alice</span>!" she said again, "how can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's
               hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> And so she went on, taking first one side, and then the other, and making quite a
               conversation of it altogether, but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside,
               which made
               her stop to listen. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Mary Ann! Mary Ann!" said the voice, "fetch me my gloves this moment!" Then came
               a little
               pattering of feet on the stairs: <span class="character">Alice</span> knew it was <span class="character">rabbit</span> coming to look for her, and she
               trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand
               times as
               large as <span class="character">rabbit</span>, and had no reason to be afraid of it. Presently <span class="character">rabbit</span> came to the
               door, and tried to open it, but as it opened inwards, and <span class="character">Alice</span>'s elbow was against it, the
               attempt proved a failure. <span class="character">Alice</span> heard it say to itself "then I'll go round and get in at the window." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "That you wo'n't!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, and, after waiting till she fancied
               she heard <span class="character">rabbit</span>, just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a
               snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek
               and a fall
               and a crash of breaking glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible
               it had
               fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Next came an angry voice—<span class="character">rabbit</span>'s—"Pat, Pat! where are you?" And then a voice she had
               never heard before, "shure then I'm here! digging for apples, anyway, yer honour!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Digging for apples indeed!" said <span class="character">rabbit</span> angrily, "here, come and help me out of this!"—Sound of more breaking glass. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Now, tell me, Pat, what is that coming out of the window?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Shure it's an arm, yer honour!" (He pronounced it "arrum".) </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "An arm, you goose! Who ever saw an arm that size? Why, it fills the whole window,
               don't you
               see?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Shure, it does, yer honour, but it's an arm for all that." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well, it's no business there: go and take it away!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> There was a long silence after this, and <span class="character">Alice</span> could only hear whispers now and then, such
               as "shure I don't like it, yer honour, at all at all!" "do as I tell you, you coward!"
               and at
               last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air. This time there
               were
               two little shrieks, and more breaking glass—"what a number of
               cucumber-frames there must be!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling
               me out of the window, I only wish they could! I'm sure I don't want to stop in here any longer!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of
               little cart-wheels, and
               the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words "where's
               the
               other ladder?—why, I hadn't to bring but one, Bill's got the other—here, put 'em up
               at this
               corner—no, tie 'em together first—they don't reach high enough yet—oh, they'll do
               well enough,
               don't be particular—here, Bill! catch hold of this rope—will the roof bear?—mind that
               loose
               slate—oh, it's coming down! heads below!—" (a loud crash) "now, who did that?—it was
               Bill, I
               fancy—who's to go down the chimney?—nay, I sha'n't! you do it!—that I won't then—Bill's got to go down—here,
               Bill! the master says you've to go down the chimney!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh, so Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?" said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, "why, they seem
               to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: the fireplace
               is a
               pretty tight one, but I think I can kick a little!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard
               a little animal (she
               couldn't guess what sort it was) scratching and scrambling in the chimney close above
               her:
               then, saying to herself "this is Bill," she gave one sharp kick, and waited again
               to see what
               would happen next. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The first thing was a general chorus of "there goes Bill!" then <span class="character">rabbit</span>'s voice alone
               "catch him, you by the hedge!" then silence, and then another confusion of voices,
               "how was
               it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell us all about it." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Last came a little feeble squeaking voice, ("that's Bill" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>,) which said "well,
               I hardly know—I'm all of a fluster myself—something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box,
               and
               the next minute up I goes like a rocket!" "And so you did, old fellow!" said the other
               voices.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "We must burn the house down!" said the voice of <span class="character">rabbit</span>, and <span class="character">Alice</span> called out as loud as
               she could "if you do, I'll set <span class="character">Dinah</span> at you!" This caused silence again, and while <span class="character">Alice</span> was
               thinking "but how can I get <span class="character">Dinah</span> here?" she found to her great delight that she was getting
               smaller: very soon she was able to get up out of the uncomfortable position in which
               she had
               been lying, and in two or three minutes more she was once more three inches high.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She ran out of the house as quick as she could, and found quite a crowd of little
               animals
               waiting outside—guinea-pigs, white mice, squirrels, and "Bill" a little green lizard,
               that was
               being supported in the arms of one of the guinea-pigs, while another was giving it
               something
               out of a bottle. They all made a rush at her the moment she appeared, but <span class="character">Alice</span> ran her
               hardest, and soon found herself in a thick wood. </p>
            
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">

            <h2 class="heading"> Chapter III </h2>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "The first thing I've got to do," said <span class="character">Alice</span> to herself, as she wandered about in the wood,
               "is to grow to my right size, and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely
               garden.
               I think that will be the best plan." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged: the
               only
               difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it, and while
               she was
               peering anxiously among the trees round her, a little sharp bark just over her head
               made her
               look up in a great hurry. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> An enormous <span class="character">puppy</span> was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out
               one paw, trying to reach her: "poor thing!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it, but
               she was terribly alarmed all the while at the thought that it might be hungry, in
               which case
               it would probably devour her in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she
               did, she
               picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the <span class="character">puppy:</span> whereupon the <span class="character">puppy</span> jumped into
               the air off all its feet at once, and with a yelp of delight rushed at the stick,
               and made
               believe to worry it then <span class="character">Alice</span> dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
               over, and, the moment she appeared at the other side, the <span class="character">puppy</span> made another dart at the
               stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold: then <span class="character">Alice</span>, thinking it was very
               like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled
               under
               its feet, ran round the thistle again: then the <span class="character">puppy</span> begin a series of short charges at the
               stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking
               hoarsely
               all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging
               out
               of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> This seemed to <span class="character">Alice</span> a good opportunity for making her escape. She set off at once, and ran
               till the <span class="character">puppy's</span> bark sounded quite faint in the distance, and till she was quite tired and
               out of breath. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "And yet what a dear little <span class="character">puppy</span> it was!" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, as she leant against a buttercup to
               rest herself, and fanned herself with her hat. "I should have liked teaching it tricks,
               if—if
               I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow
               up
               again! Let me see; how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something
               or other, but the great question is what?" </p> 
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The great question certainly was, what? <span class="character">Alice</span> looked all round her at the flowers and the
               blades of grass but could not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat
               under the
               circumstances. There was a large mushroom near her, about the same height as herself,
               and when
               she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
               to look
               and see what was on the top of it. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and
               her eyes immediately met
               those of a large blue <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, which was sitting with its arms folded, quietly smoking a
               long hookah, and taking not the least notice of her or of anything else. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> For some time they looked at each other in silence: at last the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> took the hookah
               out of its mouth, and languidly addressed her. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Who are you?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation: <span class="character">Alice</span> replied rather shyly, "I—I
               hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I know who I was when I got up this morning,
               but I
               think I must have been changed several times since that." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What do you mean by that?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, "explain yourself!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I ca'n't explain myself, I'm afraid, sir," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "because I'm not myself, you see." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I don't see," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly," <span class="character">Alice</span> replied very politely, "for I ca'n't
               understand it myself, and really to be so many different sizes in one day is very
               confusing." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It isn't," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "but when you have to turn into a
               chrysalis, you know, and then after that into a butterfly, I should think it'll feel
               a little
               queer, don't you think so?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Not a bit," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "All I know is," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "it would feel queer to me." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You!" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> contemptuously, "who are you?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation: <span class="character">Alice</span> felt a little
               irritated at the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said
               very gravely "I think you ought to tell me who you are, first." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Why?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Here was another puzzling question: and as <span class="character">Alice</span> had no reason ready, and the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> seemed to be in a
               very bad temper, she turned round and walked away. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come back!" the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> called after her, "I've something important to say!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> This sounded promising: <span class="character">Alice</span> turned and came back again. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Keep your temper," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Is that all?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, swallowing down her anger as well as she could. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "No," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after
               all
               the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away at its
               hookah without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of
               its mouth
               again, and said "so you think you're changed, do you?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Yes, sir," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I ca'n't remember the things I used to know—I've tried to say "How
               doth the little busy bee" and it came all different!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Try and repeat "You are old, father William"," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> folded her hands, and began: </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">

            <p class="paragraph"> 1. </p>
            
            
            "You are old, father William," the young man said,
            "And your hair is exceedingly white:
            And yet you incessantly stand on your head—
            Do you think, at your age, it is right?"
            
             
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 2. </p>
            
            
            "In my youth," father William replied to his son,
            "I feared it might injure the brain
            But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
            Why, I do it again and again."
            
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">

            "You are old," said the youth, "as I mentioned before,
            And have grown most uncommonly fat:
            Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—
            Pray what is the reason of that?"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 4. </p>
            
            
            "In my youth," said the sage, as he shook his gray locks,
            "I kept all my limbs very supple,
            By the use of this ointment, <span class="character">Five</span> shillings the box—
            Allow me to sell you a couple."
            
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">

            <p class="paragraph"> 5. </p>
            
            
            "You are old," said the youth, "and your jaws are too weak
            For anything tougher than suet:
            Yet you eat all the goose, with the bones and the beak—
            Pray, how did you manage to do it?"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 6. </p>
            
            
            "In my youth," said the old man, "I took to the law,
            And argued each case with my wife,
            And the muscular strength, which it
            gave to my jaw,
            Has lasted the rest of my life."
            
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">

            "You are old," said the youth; "one would hardly suppose
            That your eye was as steady as ever:
            Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—
            What made you so awfully clever?"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 8. </p>
            
            
            "I have answered three questions, and that is enough,"
            Said his father, "don't give yourself airs!
            Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
            Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "That is not said right," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Not quite right, I'm afraid," said <span class="character">Alice</span> timidly, "some of the words have got altered." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It is wrong from beginning to end," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> decidedly, and there was silence
               for some minutes: the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> was the first to speak. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What size do you want to be?" it asked. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh, I'm not particular as to size," <span class="character">Alice</span> hastily replied, "only one doesn't like changing
               so often, you know." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Are you content now?" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn't
               mind," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "three inches is such a wretched height to be." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It is a very good height indeed!" said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span> loudly and angrily, rearing itself
               straight up as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high). </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "But I'm not used to it!" pleaded poor <span class="character">Alice</span> in a piteous tone, and she thought to herself
               "I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You'll get used to it in time," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, and it put the hookah into its mouth,
               and began smoking again.
               </p> 
            
            <p class="paragraph"> This time <span class="character">Alice</span> waited quietly until it chose to speak again: in a few minutes the
               <span class="character">caterpillar</span> took the hookah out of its mouth, and got down off the mushroom, and crawled away
               into the grass, merely remarking as it went; "the top will make you grow taller, and
               the stalk
               will make you grow shorter." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "The top of what? the stalk of what?" thought
               <span class="character">Alice</span>. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Of the mushroom," said the <span class="character">caterpillar</span>, just as if she had asked it aloud, and in another
               moment was out of sight. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, and then picked it and
               carefully broke it in two, taking the stalk in one hand, and the top in the other.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Which does the stalk do?" she said, and nibbled a little bit of it
               to try; the next moment she felt a violent blow on her chin: it had struck her foot!
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but as she did not shrink
               any
               further, and had not dropped the top of the mushroom, she did not give up hope yet.
               There was
               hardly room to open her mouth, with her chin pressing against her foot, but she did
               it at
               last, and managed to bite off a little bit of the top of the mushroom. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come! my head's free at last!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in
               another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be seen: she looked
               down
               upon an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of
               green leaves
               that lay far below her. </p>
              
            
            <p class="paragraph"> 
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What can all that green stuff be?" said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "and where have my shoulders got to? And oh! my poor hands! how is it I ca'n't see
               you?" She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except
               a little
               rustling among the leaves. Then she tried to bring her head down to her hands, and
               was
               delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in every direction, like a
               serpent.
               She had just succeeded in bending it down in a beautiful zig-zag, and was going to
               dive in
               among the leaves, which she found to be the tops of the trees of the wood she had
               been
               wandering in, when a sharp hiss made her draw back: a large <span class="character">pigeon</span> had flown into her face,
               and was violently beating her with its wings. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Serpent!" screamed the <span class="character">pigeon</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I'm not a serpent!" said <span class="character">Alice</span> indignantly, "let me alone!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I've tried every way!" the <span class="character">pigeon</span> said desperately, with a kind of sob: "nothing seems to
               suit 'em!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I haven't the least idea what you mean," said <span class="character">Alice</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges," the
               <span class="character">pigeon</span>
               went on without attending to her, "but them serpents! There's no pleasing 'em!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span> was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything till
               the <span class="character">pigeon</span> had finished. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "without being on the
               look out for serpents, day and night! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three
               weeks!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I'm very sorry you've been annoyed," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, beginning to see its meaning. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood," said the <span class="character">pigeon</span> raising its voice to a
               shriek, "and was just thinking I was free of 'em at last, they must needs come down
               from the
               sky! Ugh! Serpent!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "But I'm not a serpent," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, "I'm a—I'm a—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well! What are you?" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "I see you're trying to invent
               something."
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I—I'm a little girl," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of
               changes she had gone through. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "A likely story indeed!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, "I've seen a good many of them in my time, but
               never one with such a neck as yours! No, you're a serpent, I know that well enough! I suppose you'll tell me next that you never tasted an
               egg!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I have tasted eggs, certainly," said <span class="character">Alice</span>, who was a very truthful
               child, "but indeed I do'n't want any of yours. I do'n't like them raw." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Well, be off, then!" said the <span class="character">pigeon</span>, and settled down into its nest again. <span class="character">Alice</span> crouched
               down among the trees, as well as she could, as her neck kept getting entangled among
               the
               branches, and several times she had to stop and untwist it. Soon she remembered the
               pieces of
               mushroom which she still held in her hands, and set to work very carefully, nibbling
               first at
               one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until
               she had
               succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual size. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> It was so long since she had been of the right size that it felt quite strange at
               first, but she got quite
               used to it in a minute or two, and began talking to herself as usual: "well! there's
               half my
               plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to
               be, from
               one minute to another! However, I've got to my right size again: the next thing is,
               to get
               into that beautiful garden—how is that to be done, I wonder?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a doorway leading right
               into
               it. "That's very curious!" she thought, "but everything's curious today: I may as
               well go in."
               And in she went. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table:
               "now,
               I'll manage better this time" she said to herself, and began by taking the little
               golden key,
               and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she set to work eating the pieces
               of
               mushroom till she was about fifteen inches high: then she walked down the little passage:
               and
               then—she found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the
               bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains. </p>

            <p class="paragraph">A large rose tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses on it were white,
               but
               there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red. This <span class="character"> Alice</span> thought a very curious
               thing, and she went near to watch them, and just as she came up she heard one of them
               say
               "look out, <span class="character">Five</span>! Don't go splashing paint over me like that!"</p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I couldn't help it," said <span class="character">Five</span> in a sulky tone, "Seven jogged my elbow." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> On which <span class="character">Seven</span> lifted up his head and <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said "that's right, <span class="character">Five</span>! Always lay the blame on
               others!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You'd better not talk!" said <span class="character">Five</span>, "I heard the Queen say only yesterday she thought
               of having you beheaded!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What for?" said the one who had spoken first. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "That's not your business, Two!" said <span class="character">Seven.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Yes, it is his business!" said <span class="character">Five</span>, "and I'll tell him: it was for
               bringing in tulip-roots to the cook instead of potatoes." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Seven </span>flung down his brush, and had just begun "well! Of all the unjust things—" when his
               eye fell upon <span class="character">Alice</span>, and he stopped suddenly; the others looked round, and all of them took
               off their hats and bowed low. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Would you tell me, please," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span> timidly, "why you are painting those roses?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Five</span> and Seven looked at Two, but said nothing: Two began, in a low voice, "why, Miss,
               the
               fact is, this ought to have been a red rose tree, and we put a white one in by mistake,
               and if
               the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off. So, you see, we're
               doing
               our best, before she comes, to—" At this moment <span class="character">Five</span>, who had been looking anxiously across
               the garden called out "the Queen! the Queen!" and the three gardeners instantly threw
               themselves flat upon
               their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to
               see <span class="character">the
                  Queen</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners,
               flat
               and oblong, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these
               were all
               ornamented with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these
               came the
               Royal children: there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily
               along, hand
               in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly
               kings
               and queens, among whom <span class="character"> Alice</span> recognised the <span class="character">white rabbit</span>: it was talking in a hurried nervous
               manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then
               followed
               the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a cushion, and, last of all this
               grand
               procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> When the procession came opposite to <span class="character"> Alice</span>, they all stopped and looked at her, and <span class="character">the Queen</span> <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said severely "who
               is this?" She <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Idiot!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, turning up her nose, and asked Alice "what's your name?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "My name is <span class="character">Alice</span>, so please your Majesty," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span> boldly, for she thought to herself
               "why, they're only a pack of cards! I needn't be afraid of them!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Who are these?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">Queen</span>, pointing to the<span class="character"> three gardeners</span> lying round the rose tree,
               for, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same
               as the
               rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or
               courtiers,
               or three of her own children. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "How should I know?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, surprised at her own courage, "it's
               no business of mine." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The <span class="character">Queen </span>turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a minute, began in a voice
               of thunder "off with her—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Nonsense!" said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, very loudly and decidedly, and <span class="character">the Queen</span> was silent. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">the King</span> laid his hand upon her arm, and <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said timidly "remember, my dear! She is only a
               child!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">The Queen</span> turned angrily away from him, and <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said to the Knave "turn them over!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Get up!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, in a shrill loud voice, and the <span class="character">three gardeners</span> instantly jumped
               up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the Royal children, and everybody else.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Leave off that!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>screamed <span class="character">the Queen</span>, "you make me giddy." And then, turning to the rose
               tree, she went on "what have you been doing here?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "May it please your Majesty," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said Two very humbly, going down on one knee as he spoke, "we
               were trying—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I see!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, who had meantime been examining the roses, "off with their heads!"
               and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the
               three
               unfortunate gardeners, who ran to <span class="character"> Alice</span> for protection. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You sha'n't be beheaded!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, and she put them into her pocket: the <span class="character">three soldiers</span>
               marched once round her, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Are their heads off?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>shouted <span class="character">the Queen</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Their heads are gone," <span class="character">the soldiers </span>shouted in reply, "if it please your Majesty!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "That's right!" shouted <span class="character">the Queen</span>, "can you play croquet?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">The soldiers </span> were silent, and looked at <span class="character"> Alice</span>, as the question was evidently meant for her. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Yes!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>shouted <span class="character"> Alice</span> at the top of her voice. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come on then!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>roared <span class="character">the Queen</span>, and<span class="character"> Alice </span>joined the procession, wondering very much what
               would happen next. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It's—it's a very fine day!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said a timid little voice: she was walking by the white rabbit,
               who was peeping anxiously into her face. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Very," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, "where's the Marchioness?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Hush, hush!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the rabbit</span> in a low voice, "she'll hear you. The Queen's the Marchioness:
               didn't you know that?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "No, I didn't," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, "what of?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Queen of Hearts," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the rabbit</span> in a whisper, putting its mouth close to her ear, "and
               Marchioness of <span class="character">Mock Turtles</span>." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What are they?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said<span class="character"> Alice</span>, but there was no time for the answer,
               for they had reached the croquet-ground, and the game began instantly. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="character">Alice</span>thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in all her life: it was all
               in ridges and furrows: the croquet-balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live ostriches,
               and
               the soldiers had to double themselves up, and stand on their feet and hands, to make
               the arches. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The chief difficulty which <span class="character"> Alice</span> found at first was to manage her ostrich: she got its body
               tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally,
               just as she had got its neck straightened out nicely, and was going to give a blow
               with its
               head, it would twist itself round, and look up into her face, with such
               a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had
               got its
               head down, and was going to begin again, it was very confusing to find that the hedgehog
               had
               unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was
               generally a
               ridge or a furrow in her way, wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to, and as
               the
               doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground,
               <span class="character"> Alice</span> soon came to the
               conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The players all played at once without waiting for turns, and quarrelled all the
               while at
               the tops of their voices, and in a very few minutes <span class="character">the Queen</span> was in a furious passion, and
               went stamping about and shouting "off with his head!" of "off with her head!" about
               once in a
               minute. All those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who
               of course
               had to leave off being arches to do this, so that, by the end of half an hour or so,
               there
               were no arches left, and all the players, except <span class="character">the King</span>, <span class="character">the Queen</span>, and <span class="character">Alice</span>, were in
               custody, and under sentence of execution. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Then <span class="character">the Queen </span>left off, quite out of breath, and <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said to <span class="character">Alice</span> "have you seen the Mock
               Turtle?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "No," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">Alice,</span> "I don't even know what a<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span> is." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come on then," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, "and it shall tell you its history." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> As they walked off together, <span class="character">Alice</span> heard <span class="character">the King</span> say in a low voice, to the company
               generally, "you are all pardoned." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come, that's a good thing!" thought <span class="character">Alice</span>, who had felt quite grieved at the number of executions which<span class="character"> the Queen</span>
               had ordered. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, which lay fast asleep in the sun: (if you don't
               know
               what a Gryphon is, look at the picture): "Up, lazy thing!" said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, "and take this
               young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear its history. I must go back and see
               after some
               executions I ordered," and she walked off, leaving<span class="character"> Alice</span> with the <span class="character">Gryphon.</span> <span class="character"> Alice</span> did not quite
               like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it quite as safe to stay
               as to go
               after that savage Queen: so she waited. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The <span class="character">Gryphon </span>sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched<span class="character"> the Queen</span> till she was out of sight:
               then it chuckled. "What fun!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, half to itself, half to <span class="character">Alice.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What is the fun?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Why, she," said the<span class="character"> Gryphon</span>; "it's all her fancy, that: they never
               executes nobody, you know: come on!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Everybody says 'come on!' here," thought <span class="character">Alice</span>as she walked slowly after the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>; "I
               never was ordered about so before in all my life—never!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> They had not gone far before they saw the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> in the distance, sitting sad and
               lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, <span class="character"> Alice</span> could here it sighing as if
               its heart would break. She pitied it deeply: "what is its sorrow?" she asked the Gryphon,
               and
               the <span class="character">Gryphon </span>answered, very nearly in the same words as before, "it's all its fancy, that: it
               hasn't got no sorrow, you know: come on!" </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So they went up to the<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but
               said nothing. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "This here young lady" said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, "wants for to know your history, she do." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I'll tell it," said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, in a deep hollow tone, "sit down, and don't speak till
               I've finished." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So they sat down, and no one spoke for some minutes: <span class="character">Alice</span> thought to herself "I don't see
               how it can ever finish, if it doesn't begin," but she waited patiently. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Once," said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> at last, with a deep sigh, "I was a real Turtle." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation
               of "hjckrrh!" from the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, and the constant heavy sobbing of the <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>. <span class="character">Alice</span> was
               very nearly getting up and saying, "thank you, sir, for your interesting story," but
               she could
               not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said
               nothing. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "When we were little," the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> went on, more calmly, though still sobbing a little
               now and then, "we went to school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used
               to call him
               Tortoise—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?" asked<span class="character"> Alice.</span>
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "We called him Tortoise because he taught us," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> angrily, "really you are
               very dull!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question," added the
               <span class="character">Gryphon</span>,
               and then they both sat silent and looked at poor <span class="character">Alice,</span> who felt ready to sink into the earth:
               at last the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said to the<span class="character"> Mock Turtle.</span>, "get on, old fellow! Don't be all day!" and the
               <span class="character">Gryphon</span> went on in these words: </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "You may not have lived much under the sea—" ("I haven't,"<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span> said<span class="character"> Alice</span>,) "and perhaps you
               were never even introduced to a lobster—" (<span class="character">Alice</span> began to say "I once tasted—" but hastily
               checked herself, and <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said "no, never," instead,) "so you can have no idea what a delightful
               thing a Lobster Quadrille is!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "No, indeed," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, "what sort of a thing is it?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Why," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, "you form into a line along the sea shore—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Two lines!" cried the<span class="character"> Mock Turtle,</span> "seals, turtles, salmon, and so on—advance twice—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Each with a lobster as partner!" cried the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Of course," the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said, "advance twice, set to partners—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Change lobsters, and retire in same order—" interrupted the<span class="character"> Gryphon</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Then, you know," continued the Mock Turtle, "you throw the—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "The lobsters!" shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "As far out to sea as you can—" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Swim after them!" screamed the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Turn a somersault in the sea!" cried the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, capering wildly about. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Change lobsters again!" yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice, "and then—"
               </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "That's all," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the<span class="character"> Mock Turtle.</span>, suddenly dropping its voice, and the two creatures, who
               had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and
               quietly,
               and looked at <span class="character">Alice</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "It must be a very pretty dance," said <span class="character"> Alice</span> timidly. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Would you like to see a little of it?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character"> Mock Turtle.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Very much indeed," said <span class="character"> Alice</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come, let's try the first figure!" said the<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span> to the<span class="character"> Gryphon</span>, "we can do it without lobsters, you
               know. Which shall sing?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh! you sing!"<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span> said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, "I've forgotten the words." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So they began solemnly dancing round and round <span class="character"> Alice</span>, every now and then treading on her
               toes when they came too close, and waving their fore-paws to mark the time, while
               the <span class="character">Mock
                  Turtle </span>sang, slowly and sadly, these words: </p>
            
            
            "Beneath the waters of the sea
            Are lobsters thick as thick can be—
            They love to dance with you and me,
            My own, my gentle Salmon!"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The <span class="character">Gryphon</span> joined in singing the chorus, which was: </p>
            
            
            "Salmon come up! Salmon go down!
            Salmon come twist your tail around!
            Of all the fishes of the sea
            There's none so good as Salmon!"
            
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Thank you," <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">Alice</span>, feeling very glad that the figure was over. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Shall we try the second figure?" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, "or would you prefer a song?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh, a song, please!" <span class="character">Alice</span> replied, so eagerly, that the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said, in a rather offended
               tone, "hm! no accounting for tastes! Sing her 'Mock Turtle Soup', will you, old fellow!"
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The<span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>sobs, to sing
               this: </p>
            
            
            "Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
            Waiting in a hot tureen!
            Who for such dainties would not stoop?
            Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
            Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
            Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
            Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!
            Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
            Beautiful beautiful Soup!
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Chorus again!" cried the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, and the <span class="character">Gryphon</span> had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of "the trial's
               beginning!" was heard in the distance. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Come on!" cried the <span class="character">Gryphon</span>, and, taking <span class="character"> Alice</span> by the hand, he hurried off, without waiting
               for the end of the song. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "What trial is it?" panted <span class="character"> Alice</span> as she ran, but the<span class="character"> Gryphon </span>only answered "come on!" and
               ran the faster, and more and more faintly came, borne on the breeze that followed
               them, the
               melancholy words: </p>
            
            
            "Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,
            Beautiful beautiful Soup!"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> The <span class="character">King and Queen</span> were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd
               assembled around them: the Knave was in custody: and before<span class="character"> the King</span>stood the<span class="character"> white rabbit</span>,
               with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph">
               
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Herald! read the accusation!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said the <span class="character">King</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> On this the <span class="character">white rabbit </span>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment
               scroll, and read as follows: </p>
            
            
            "The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
            All on a summer day:
            The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts,
            And took them quite away!"
            
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Now for the evidence," said <span class="character">the King</span>, "and then the sentence." </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "No!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>, "first the sentence, and then the evidence!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Nonsense!" cried <span class="character">Alice</span>, so loudly that everybody jumped, "the idea of having the sentence
               first!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Hold your tongue!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character">the Queen</span>. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "I won't!" said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, "you're nothing but a pack of cards! Who cares for you?" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave
               a
               little scream of fright, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the
               bank, with
               her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some leaves that had
               fluttered
               down from the trees on to her face.
               </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Wake up! <span class="character">Alice</span> dear!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said her sister, "what a nice long sleep you've had!" </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> "Oh, I've had such a curious dream!" <span class="character"> Mock Turtle</span>said <span class="character"> Alice</span>, and she told her sister all her Adventures
               Under Ground, as you have read them, and when she had finished, her sister kissed
               her and said
               "it was a curious dream, dear, certainly! But now run in to your tea:
               it's getting late." </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> So <span class="character"> Alice</span> ran off, thinking while she ran (as well she might) what a wonderful dream it had
               been. </p>
            
            
            <p class="paragraph"> But her sister sat there some while longer, watching the setting sun, and thinking
               of little
               <span class="character">Alice</span>and her Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her
               dream: </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> <span class="nonsense">She saw an ancient city, and a quiet river winding near it along the plain, and up
                  the
                  stream went slowly gliding a boat with a merry party of children on board—she could
                  hear their
                  voices and laughter like music over the water—and among them was another little Alice,
                  who sat
                  listening with bright eager eyes to a tale that was being told, and she listened for
                  the words
                  of the tale, and lo! it was the dream of her own little sister. So the boat wound
                  slowly along, beneath the
                  bright summer-day, with its merry crew and its music of voices and laughter, till
                  it passed
                  round one of the many turnings of the stream, and she saw it no more.</span> </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph"> Then she thought, (in a dream within the dream, as it were,) how this same little
               Alice
               would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman: and how she would keep, through
               her riper
               years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather around
               her other
               little children, and make their eyes bright and eager with many a
               wonderful tale, perhaps even with these very adventures of the little Alice of long-ago:
               and
               how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their
               simple
               joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days. </p>
