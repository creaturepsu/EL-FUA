           <h1>Transcript (real)</h1>
        <p>S:OWWW</p>
        <p>M:OW. Get up MAN</p>
        <p>He runs into the room and shuts the door, with milo welding it shut</p>
        <p>M:the stairs, dont forget</p>
        <p>He shoves a desk, chair, stuffed animal, computer, water bottle, and some lotion and
            tissues down the stairs</p>
        <p>M:quit clowning man</p>
        <p>S:IM UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE</p>
        <p>M:help me get upstairs. I know where the crate of emps is</p>
        <p>He gets shoved up the ladder while spencers stands guard</p>
        <p>M:shit where is it… a trail of garbage? Yuca you’re so sly</p>
        <p>He finds the crate and limps back slowly</p>
        <p>S:BRO HURRY PLEASE</p>
        <p>M:IM TRYING</p>
        <p>*BANG*</p>
        <p>S:AUUUHGHHHH</p>
        <p>M:spencers…*he drops the emps and they detonate by accident. He falls unconscious and
            blacks out* [EVERYTHING UNTIL MILO WAKES UP IS AN OUTSIDE POV OF HIM]</p>
        <p>S:what? FUCK theres more coming *he limps to the ladder* MILO HURRY…MILO HELP ME</p>
        <p>He falls on the floor unconscious</p>
        <p>S:dude…</p>
        <p>His body lays limp on the floor as a grunt pulls it up and kicks his skull in, then rips
            off his left arm</p>
        <p>S:*barfs and cries a little*</p>
        <p>his eyes flash and bluescreen, then starts making unnatural cracking sounds[this is like
            the exorcist lowkey] he moves, His flesh semi-melting and forming into small tendrils
            around his body. Small drops of metal float around him in a sphere and he starts to
            slowly get up</p>
        <p>G:? *on radio* backup come in… back up come in… backup respond *SLICE*</p>
        <p>Milo’s unconscious body heats up his arm and slices the grunt in half, then he makes his
            way to the stairs after absorbing the energy of the dead grunt</p>
        <p>S:LOOK OUT</p>
        <p>His body heats up and a jet of molten metal shoots through the grunts climbing up. The
            skin surrounding his arm is gone, exposing the titanium bone underneath. He heads
            downstairs and walks in the middle of the gunfire, his body absorbing all of it and
            growing in mass</p>
        <p>J:WHAT ARE YOU DOING? MOVE</p>
        <p>Eventually the grunts run out of ammo, and he’s completely fine. A loud trumpeting noise
            can be heard coming from his mouth, he walks up to each grunt and tears it’s limbs off
            with his teeth, swallowing them whole. If he gets shoved, their hands melt into milo’s
            skin. Spencers keeps watching in disbelief and horror while everyone ceases fire. The
            hole in milo’s chest shines through his shirt as a ring [tony stark type beat]. The
            grunts decide to retreat but get gunned down by everyone else waiting by the gate. After
            milo looks around for a bit, he falls backwards and he’s mostly healed, just regrowing
            and arm and parts of his skull</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Evry1:*panic and loud yelling*</p>
        <p>Y:CALM DOWN PEOPLE. Dont you realise what happened?</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>Y:we won :D</p>
        <p>S:ARE YOU PRETENDING TO BE STUPID OR CAN YOU REALLY NOT READ THE ROOM?</p>
        <p>[chapter end]</p>
