            <h3>FAQ:</h3>
            <p>Q:What inspired you to create this?</p>
            <p>
                A:I guess I just wanted to have something I'd fully enjoy reading. look at yourself
                and make a change right? there's lots of good media out there which were my
                inspirations for the story, with games like "cave story" "border lands" and "hollow
                knight" or movies like "the 5th wave" "hellboy" and "project almanac" which helped
                me figure out what mood and tone I wanted for the story. There's also equally as
                much bad stuff out there that makes me question who the target audience even is (yet
                it's EXTREMELY popular) so I figured why not give it a shot if that kinda stuff can
                get popular with people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Q:Who was the inspiration for your character?
            </p>
            <p>
                A:As embarrassing as it sounds, it's me? (but not really). I figured making a
                character much like yourself would be boring and kinda weird, so instead I
                exaggerated every negative aspect of myself until it felt like an entirely different
                person. It's much more interesting seeing someone start at 0 and climb up, than a
                stable person who can do things easily and be the hero.
            </p>
            <p>
                Q:Can you tell us when the second part will come out?
            </p>
            <p>
                A:cant say for sure. it was difficult learning to write, draw, and pay attention to
                extra details until I felt like I had a good enough product. I want to say part 2
                will come out much quicker, but the reality is I'm still a perfectionist. The good
                news is the story will look and feel much cleaner though.
